# About Me

I am a graduated student of Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology (SIIT), Thammasat University, Thailand. My master's research focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP) especially in Machine Translation, Neural Language Models and Linguistic Tools. I am also interested in Large Language Models, Parsing and Machine Learning (ML). My long-term research goal is to carry out end-to-end approach that can solve the real-world NLP probelms efficiently. My email is x@gmail.com where x is myaeisan1995.
